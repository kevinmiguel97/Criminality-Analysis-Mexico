<a id="purpose"></a>
## Purpose
Several factors must be considered when evaluating a loan granted by a financial instituions: liquidity, repayment capacity, leverage, financial ratios are examples of one of the most common ones. However, there some other more subtle attributes of loanees that might make a difference and that sometimes are easily overlooked. For Fintech companies that rely on more sophisticated ways to evaualte their applications, looking for these underlying factors takes a higher relevance. 

One factor that has been underexplored in recent years for this purpose is the level of criminality that exists in a specific region where a credit is been granted. 
The purpose of this project is to generate a database of the level of criminality that exists in MÃ©xico at a municipality or neighborhood level, depending on the available data. This database will be used for future projects of Data Science and Machine Learning models to predict in a more accurate way the probability of default.
